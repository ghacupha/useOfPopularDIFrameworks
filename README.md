# Use of Popular DI Frameworks

Code borrowed from https://github.com/lestard/EasyDI/wiki/Tutorial <br><br>

This is a simple coffee app that seeks to illustrate and mostly serve as reminder to 
self of how various DI frameworks are applied to a typical dependency resolution scenario
an in particular through implementation of the JSR330 specification.
I will try to include a number of so called "Light-weights" like feather, EasyDI, 
as well as some "heavy-weights", like Spring,Weld and so on and so forth <br>

# This is not a performace Test
<br>
In fact speed is not a relevant factor. Only a show case for the curious as to how the 
guys on the other side of the fence do it.<br>

If you have something exotic that implements JSR330, or one that is so cool that it 
makes JSR330 look bad, you are more than welcome to fork this and send me a pull request
or just do an email to mailnjeru@gmail.com
